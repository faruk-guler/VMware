# Environment
VMware vCenter Server Appliance 6.7.x
VMware vCenter Server 7.0.x
VMware vCenter Server 8.0.x

# Impact/Risks:
- This issue is an erroneous alarm that does not affect the operations of vCenter Server.
- There is no impact to the vCenter Server
- If on vCenter 6.7 version less than U1b - you can safely ignore the alarm.
- There will be no alarm even if partition is 100% full - as this is by design, and has no impact on the running of the vCenter.

1. The above command removes old WAL segments files that are older than 300 days, and the job will be executed daily at 23:00. Either the 300-day or the 23:00 execution time can be modified according to the customer's requirements or environments.
2. For vCenter upgrades, if the process does not succeed, this change may need to be reverted or redeployed.
